**5) Bonus: Why is there no "back to homepage" link in the catalog app?**

* In order to go back to the homepage, I think you would need to include a hyperlink or button with the homepage URL in the catalog app. 

**Is there anything else we can do to make these apps better?**

* The aforementioned back button feature would definitely be helpful; without it, I found myself closing the application everytime to access a new application. 
* A table of contents of the different apps (hyperlinked) on the side of each page would make navigating the apps easier. 
* In addition to the search feature, a sort feature may be useful as well (sort by publish-date, alphabet, popularity, etc.). 
* This is more specific, but we could add previews of each book (first few pages) along with a simple summary. This would require each listed book to be hyperlinked to a page with more info. 

**Additional Thought**

Since our chat last week, I've been thinking about the question you asked regarding what programs/apps you should include, knowing that games particularly interest the kids. Perhaps:
* Games that include an aspect of competition, this always garners so much energy and enjoyment (like the mario-kart-esque game). This could be multiplayer or solo player with a leaderboard.
* Games that are progress-based: a game/program that allows each user to save their progress every time they play, and continues to build up to something more & more grand (like stardew valley)
* Games that can be played interestingly in less than 20 minutes: a game where each round is <20 minutes or a fulfilling/engaging session can be played. 
* Games with competitive teamwork: a game that allows a group of users to compete with other groups. Each group must work together to face the other teams.
